    <p>Hey! Im Anita. Im from Virginia attending BYUI for the tuition benefits for members.
        Im studying biomedical science and I hope to use this degree to become a dentist in the
        future.
    </p>
    <p>I'm taking this class along with other computer science and web development classes
        because I just like coding as a hobby. My other hobbies include art, writing, reading and
        listening to music.
    </p>
    <p>I hope this is a fun class where I can learn alot!</p>
